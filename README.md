### Why?!
Tacos, that's why!

### Seriously?
Well, yes... and no. This is a just a way to learn new things. Javascript, Angular, Sails.js, and other stuff.

### What does it do?
To find the best tacos in the city, you need consistent reviews. The best reviews lead to the best tacos. Plus, we all know Yelp reviews are sometimes huh...  crappy. The goal here is to parse tacos shops reviews to see if there are duplicates, or duplicated parts. The thought behind is that duplicated reviews mean that someone copy pasted reviews, which probably means... something. Hey, this is a learning activity. It doesn't have to be useful.

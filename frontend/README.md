frontend
============
This is an example AngularJS application to demonstrate how to use separate back- and frontend applications. Currently
this demo contains following features:

* Login with backend
* JWT token authentication after login
* Simple list view (Books / Authors) to demonstrate socket communications
* Generic error handler which is attached to $http and $sailsSocket
* Message service to show specified messages to users
* Live chat to demonstrate subscribe actions

## Used components
This frontend application uses following 3rd party libraries to make all this magic happen.

* slush-angular (https://github.com/slushjs/slush-angular)
* AngularJS (https://github.com/angular/angular.js)
* AngularUI Router (https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)
* AngularUI Bootstrap (https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap)
* angular-moment (https://github.com/urish/angular-moment)
* Angular Bootstrap Show Errors (https://github.com/paulyoder/angular-bootstrap-show-errors)
* angular-linkify (https://github.com/scottcorgan/angular-linkify)
* angularSails (https://github.com/balderdashy/angularSails)
* Bootstrap (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
* bootswatch (https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/)
* Font Awesome (https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)
* noty - A jQuery Notification Plugin (https://github.com/needim/noty)
* Sails JavaScript Client SDK (https://github.com/balderdashy/sails.io.js)

Note that this list may not be complete.

## Development

To start developing in the project run:

```bash
gulp serve
```

Then head to `http://localhost:3001` in your browser.

The `serve` tasks starts a static file server, which serves the AngularJS application, and a watch task which watches
all files for changes and lints, builds and injects them into the index.html accordingly.

## Tests

To run tests run:

```bash
gulp test
```

**Or** first inject all test files into `karma.conf.js` with:

```bash
gulp karma-conf
```

Then you're able to run Karma directly. Example:

```bash
karma start --single-run
```

## Production ready build - a.k.a. dist

To make the app ready for deploy to production run:

```bash
gulp dist
```

Now there's a `./dist` folder with all scripts and stylesheets concatenated and minified, also third party libraries
installed with bower will be concatenated and minified into `vendors.min.js` and `vendors.min.css` respectively.

To run your deployment code run:

```bash
gulp production
```

Then head to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
